We are going to make a functional website using Python and Flask(Python's Framework).

Topics:
1. Sign up an user
2. Create new user's account
3. How u store them in a database.
4. Log into user accounts.
5. Log out of them.
6. Associating info with specific user.

Crux:
We are devloping a very simple yet full of learning, Notes application.

Project Walkaround:
1. Create an account
2. Add notes/make new notes.
3. Delete notes.
4. Sign out
5. Sign in any pc to your account, u have yr notes.


Notes:

    Flask:
        Flask is a super light-weight framework.
        It allows us to make website really quickly and easily.
        Not as powerfull as django neither used as much in production.
        It is way more simple than django.
        We can create website way faster.

        Installation:
            pip3 install flask <- to install flask 
            pip3 install flask-login <- to use login module of flask
            pip3 install flask-sqlalchemy <- to use databases (ORM for SQL and PostGre SQL, think it of as a "wrapper")
