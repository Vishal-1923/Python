Python is a web devlopment Framework.
Often refered as Micro Framework becoz it's very simple and minimilistic.

We'll create a virtual environment becoz we want to have an isolated project where we only have project related packages and package versions.
Major advantage of it is: the convinience to create a requirements.txt file, to deploy as well as containerize.

 To create a virtual environment:
 -> python3 -m venv <name of virtual env directory>
 
 We need to configure VS Code, 
 
 to activate virtual env
 source .venv/bin/activate
 
 to check if this is working:
 pip3 freeze -> will list down all the installed packages
 install flask
 
 to make a requirements file
 pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt : to install all those packages
