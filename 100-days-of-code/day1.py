# **************************************************************************
# I am starting my new journey, learning Python.
# My flow will be
# 1. Python
# 2. Projects (2-3)
# 3. Database (SQL/NOSql)
# 4. Django/Flask
# 5. Projects
# 6. AWS/Deployment - what other things i can do with this.
# **************************************************************************

# Installing Python
# -> in case of Ubuntu (Linux/Unix), it comes pre-installed.
# -> type python3 and u r good to go :)

# Good Things to know:
#  can be done on Replit, basically full fledged learning but on 1 web tab.
#   by typing python3 on terminal, one can see python's repl -> read evaluate print loop. There u can perform basic operations.

# What is Programming?
# 1. A way to tell computer what to do. As Computer is a "dumb" machine which do whatever is told to it.

# Python
#   dynamically typed
#   supports object-oriented programming as well as functional programming approach.
#   interpreted and high-level programming language.
#   devloped by Guido van Russom in 1989-1991.
#   named after Monty Python's circus.
#   easiest to learn Programming Language.

# Features of Python
#   simple and easy to understand.
#   interpreted and platform independent -> makes debugging very easy. Q. What does being platform independent means.???
#   open source
#   very big library support -> numpy, tensorflow, selenium, opencv, etc.
#   integrating other programming languages within python is possible.

# Use cases:
#   used in data visualization to create plots and graphical representation.
#   helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
#   used in AI and Machine Learning to stimulate human behaviour and to learn from past data without hard coding.
#   creating web - applications
#   handle databases
#   used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.
