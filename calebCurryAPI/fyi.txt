This is part of Caleb Curry's tutorial for API.

Right now, we r trying to consume 'Stack Overflow' API.

We can get access to all stack overflow questions via the their api. So we'll use that for our understanding...

go to api.stackexchange.com
go to documentation.
go to questions under questions category.

/2.3/questions?order=desc&sort=activity&site=stackoverflow --> this is the api endpoint for questions.
observation: there are some query parameters involved like order, sort.

if u wanna see the actual result just copy this and paste it over the url space and write it after stackexchange.com
like this: https://api.stackexchange.com/2.3/questions?order=desc&sort=activity&site=stackoverflow
this will show u all the questions.

in order to work with api, use a tool named "POSTMAN", as it provides heck load of features....
just put the url in url's place and hit send with GET attribute and ta-da, u will see the request. This request is in form of JSON.

Now we will make our own app just to consume this api.

when u just print response via print(response) --> u will get <Response [200]>  which basically means ok. 200 is a response status code.
to see data, just add .json() to it.
we can iterate over all the lists of questions and even grab something more specifically like :
for question in response.json()['items']:
    print(question)
    print()

this is how u can consume an api and so your customization as per your need...
